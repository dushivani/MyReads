# MyReads

## About the project
In this MyReads project, we have to create a bookshelf app that allows us to select and categorize books we have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application.
	The main page has three shelves that users can use to place the books in appropriate shelves. The search page allows users to search for new books to add to their shelves. After selecting books to add to shelves, when user navigate back to the home page the selections made on the search page can be seen on the respective shelves. This project uses React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
